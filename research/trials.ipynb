Instead,\\nSamuel observed that machines don’t require a direct \\ninput command\\n to\\nperform a set task but rather \\ninput data\\n.\\n \\nFigure 2: Comparison of Input Command vs Input Data\\n \\nAn example of an input command is typing “2+2” into a programming\\nlanguage such as Python and hitting “Enter.”\\n>>> 2+2\\n4\\n>>>\\nThis represents a direct command with a direct answer.\\nInput data, however, is different.

In the\\nsecond scenario, the machine assessed the physical features of previous\\nbaseball MVPs among various other features such as age and education.\\nHowever, in neither of these two scenarios was your machine explicitly\\nprogrammed to produce a direct outcome. You fed the input data and\\nconfigured the nominated algorithms, but the final prediction was determined\\nby the machine through self-learning and data modeling.\\nYou can think of building a data model as similar to training a guide dog.\\nThrough specialized training, guide dogs learn how to respond in various\\nsituations. For example, the dog will learn to heel at a red light or to safely\\nlead its master around obstacles. If the dog has been properly trained, then,\\neventually, the trainer will no longer be required; the guide dog will be able\\nto apply its training in various unsupervised situations. Similarly, machine\\nlearning models can be trained to form decisions based on past experience.\\nA simple example is creating a model that detects spam email messages. The\\nmodel is trained to block emails with suspicious subject lines and body text\\ncontaining three or more flagged keywords: dear friend, free, invoice, PayPal,\\nViagra, casino, payment, bankruptcy, and winner. At this stage, though, we\\nare not yet performing machine learning. If we recall the visual representation\\nof \\ninput command vs input data\\n, we can see that this process consists of only\\ntwo steps: Command > Action.\\nMachine learning entails a three-step process: Data > Model > Action.\\nThus, to incorporate machine learning into our spam detection system, we\\nneed to switch out “command” for “data” and add “model” in order to\\nproduce an action (output). In this example, the data comprises sample emails\\nand the model consists of statistical-based rules. The parameters of the model\\ninclude the same keywords from our original negative list. The model is then\\ntrained and tested against the data.\\nOnce the data is fed into the model, there is a strong chance that assumptions\\ncontained in the model will lead to some inaccurate predictions. For example,\\nunder the rules of this model, the following email subject line would\\nautomatically be classified as spam: “\\nPayPal\\n has received your \\npayment\\n for\\nCasino\\n Royale purchased on eBay.”'),\n",

Machine learning, on the\\nother hand, can adapt and modify assumptions through its three-step process\\nand by reacting to errors.\\n \\nTraining & Test Data\\nIn machine learning, data is split into \\ntraining data\\n and \\ntest data\\n. The first\\nsplit of data, i.e. the initial reserve of data you use to develop your\\n \\nmodel,\\nprovides the training data. In the spam email detection example, false\\npositives similar to the PayPal auto-response might be detected from the\\ntraining data.

But the algorithm family they’re most likely to use is\\nneural networks (introduced in Chapter 10), which comes with its own\\nselection of advanced machine learning libraries.\\nWhile Scikit-learn offers a range of popular shallow algorithms, TensorFlow\\nis the machine learning library of choice for deep learning/neural networks as\\nit supports numerous advanced techniques including automatic calculus for\\nback-propagation/gradient descent. Due to the depth of resources,\\ndocumentation, and jobs available with TensorFlow, it is the obvious\\nframework to learn today.\\nPopular alternative neural network libraries include Torch, Caffe, and the\\nfast-growing Keras. Written in Python, Keras is an open-source deep learning\\nlibrary that runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, and other frameworks, and\\nallows users to perform fast experimentation in fewer lines of code. Like a\\nWordPress website theme, Keras is minimal, modular, and quick to get up\\nand running but is less flexible compared with TensorFlow and other\\nlibraries. Users will sometimes utilize Keras to validate their model before\\nswitching to TensorFlow to build a more customized model.\\nCaffe is also open-source and commonly used to develop deep learning\\narchitectures for image classification and image segmentation. Caffe is\\nwritten in C++ but has a Python interface that also supports GPU-based\\nacceleration using the Nvidia CuDNN.\\nReleased in 2002, Torch is well established in the deep learning community.\\nIt is open-source and based on the programming language Lua. Torch offers a\\nrange of algorithms for deep learning and is used within Facebook, Google,\\nTwitter, NYU, IDIAP, Purdue as well as other companies and research labs.\\n \\n[7]\\nUntil recently, Theano was another competitor to TensorFlow but as of late\\n2017, contributions to the framework have officially ceased.\\nSometimes used beside neural networks is another advanced approach called\\nensemble modeling.

For beginners starting out in machine\\nlearning, there are a number of options. One is to source your own dataset\\nfrom writing a web crawler in Python or utilizing a click-and-drag tool such\\nas Import.io to crawl the Internet. However, the easiest and best option to get\\nstarted is by visiting kaggle.com.\\nAs mentioned throughout this book, Kaggle offers free datasets for\\ndownload. This saves you the time and effort of sourcing and formatting your\\nown dataset. Meanwhile, you also have the opportunity to discuss and\\nproblem-solve with other users on the forum, join competitions, and simply\\nhang out and talk about data.\\nBear in mind, however, that datasets you download from Kaggle will\\ninherently need some refining (through scrubbing) to tailor to the machine\\nlearning model that you decide to build. Below are four free sample datasets\\nfrom Kaggle that may prove useful to your further learning in this field.\\n \\nWorld Happiness Report\\nWhat countries rank the highest in overall happiness? Which factors\\ncontribute most to happiness? How did country rankings change between the\\n2015 and 2016 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or\\ndecrease in happiness? These are the questions you can ask of this dataset\\nrecording happiness scores and rankings using data from the Gallup World\\nPoll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation questions\\nasked in the poll.\\n \\nHotel Reviews\\nDoes having a five-star reputation lead to more disgruntled guests, and\\nconversely, can two-star hotels rock the guest ratings by setting low\\nexpectations and over-delivering? Or are one and two-star rated hotels simply\\nrated low for a reason? Find all this out from this sample dataset of hotel\\nreviews. This particular dataset covers 1,000 hotels and includes hotel name,\\nlocation, review date, text, title, username, and rating.

They\\ncontinue to fill factory floors and manufacturing plants, but now their\\ncapabilities extend beyond manual activities to cognitive tasks that, until\\nrecently, only humans were capable of performing. Judging song\\ncompetitions, driving automobiles, and mopping the floor with professional\\nchess players are three examples of the specific complex tasks machines are\\nnow capable of simulating.\\nBut their remarkable feats trigger fear among some observers.

Delays and other obstacles are inevitable.\\nNor is machine learning a simple case of flicking a switch and asking the\\nmachine to predict the outcome of the Super Bowl and serve you a delicious\\nmartini.

For example, the creator of the\\nMelbourne Housing Market dataset has misspelled “Longitude” and\\n“Latitude” in the head columns.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ml-book.pdf'}, page_content='DOWNLOADING DATASETS\\nBefore you can start practicing algorithms and building machine learning\\nmodels, you will first need data. For beginners starting out in machine\\nlearning, there are a number of options. One is to source your own dataset\\nfrom writing a web crawler in Python or utilizing a click-and-drag tool such\\nas Import.io to crawl the Internet. However, the easiest and best option to get\\nstarted is by visiting kaggle.com.\\nAs mentioned throughout this book, Kaggle offers free datasets for\\ndownload. This saves you the time and effort of sourcing and formatting your\\nown dataset. Meanwhile, you also have the opportunity to discuss and\\nproblem-solve with other users on the forum, join competitions, and simply\\nhang out and talk about data.\\nBear in mind, however, that datasets you download from Kaggle will\\ninherently need some refining (through scrubbing) to tailor to the machine\\nlearning model that you decide to build. Below are four free sample datasets\\nfrom Kaggle that may prove useful to your further learning in this field.\\n \\nWorld Happiness Report\\nWhat countries rank the highest in overall happiness? Which factors\\ncontribute most to happiness? How did country rankings change between the\\n2015 and 2016 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or\\ndecrease in happiness? These are the questions you can ask of this dataset\\nrecording happiness scores and rankings using data from the Gallup World\\nPoll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation questions\\nasked in the poll.\\n \\nHotel Reviews\\nDoes having a five-star reputation lead to more disgruntled guests, and\\nconversely, can two-star hotels rock the guest ratings by setting low\\nexpectations and over-delivering? Or are one and two-star rated hotels simply\\nrated low for a reason? Find all this out from this sample dataset of hotel\\nreviews. This particular dataset covers 1,000 hotels and includes hotel name,\\nlocation, review date, text, title, username, and rating. The dataset is sourced\\nfrom the Datafiniti’s Business Database, which includes almost every hotel in'),\n",
